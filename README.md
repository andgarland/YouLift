YouLift is a workout application that lets the user create a customized workout routine and log their results to compare and track progress over time. It supplies a list of pre-made workouts to use and edit, and the ability to create a new workout, either using existing exercises or making new ones.

Our typical user could range from a first time gym goer to professional athlete. By supplying default workouts for brand new users unfamiliar with the gym, while also logging completed workouts so a veteran user can track their progress, the app is designed for both the novice and expert lifter. Anyone that has any interest in working out is a target user for YouLift.
